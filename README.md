# flipkod-slice

This is solution for task hosted on http://ph.flipkod.com/T1760 .

1. Globally install `node` and `npm` if you don't have it
1. Run `npm install` in project root 
1. Eventually set up file watcher to compile `assets/style/main.scss` with SASS compiler to `assets/style/main.css` 
1. Open `index.html` with your favorite browser - tested only in Firefox for now

Not tested much - looks good on 1024px and more, masonry part looks good on 1468px and more in Firefox.
Wasn't sure how much 'intelligent coding' was needed in the task, I would say this solution is semi-good and
semi-future-proof, some parts are made well, some parts can be made better. Also, I felt free to make my own decisions
on some design dilemmas. Anyway, any decision made in developing has foundation and can be explained additionally if
needed.
