# flipkod-slice

This is solution (still in progress) for task hosted on http://ph.flipkod.com/T1760 .

1. Globally install `node` and `npm` if you don't have it
1. Run `npm install` in project root 
1. Eventually set up file watcher to compile `assets/style/main.scss` with SASS compiler to `assets/style/main.css` 
1. Open `index.html` with your favorite browser - tested only in Firefox for now
